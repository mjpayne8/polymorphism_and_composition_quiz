# Polymorphism & Composition Homework - Quiz

# Polymorphism

1. What does the ___word___ 'polymorphism' mean?
It means one thing can take multiple forms.

2. What does it mean when we apply polymorphism to OO design? Give a simple Java example.
It means an object can have multiple types. This means we can store objects with some common behaviour together though they are different classes. A car can be both of vehicle type and car type.

3. What can we use to implement polymorphism in Java?
We can use classes and interfaces.

4. How many 'forms' can an object take when using polymorphism?
It can take as many forms as interfaces implemented.

5. Give an example of when you could use polymorphism.
To store car and motorbike classes in the same array by implementing a vehicle interface in both.


# Composition

6. What do we mean by 'composition' in reference to object-oriented programming?
Composition is when an object contains other objects.

7. When would you use composition? Provide a simple example in Java.
When the relationship is 'has-a'. For example a car class may contain an engine class object.

8. What is/are the advantage(s) of using composition?
It allows us to reuse code, design clean api's and allow us to change class behaviour by adapting composite class behaviour.

9. When an object is destroyed, what happens to all the objects it is composed of?
They still exist.
